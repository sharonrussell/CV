# Sharon Russell

 I have been working as a Senior Software Engineer for 4 years now and I have 8 years experience in software engineering. I have a keen interest in SOLID principles and best practices and strive to include these in the work I produce. One of my strongest skills is the ability to analyse requirements to a fine detail and translate these requirements into clean, maintainable code. I am also pragmatic and friendly and this shows in my working relationships
